=head1 NAME

TAP::Harness::Remote::EC2 - Run tests on EC2 servers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    prove --harness TAP::Harness::Remote::EC2 t/*.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Based on L<TAP::Harness::Remote>, this module uses your running Amazon
EC2 instances (L<http://amazon.com/ec2>) to run tests against, instead
of a preconfigured list of hosts.

=head1 USAGE

Configuration is much the same as L<TAP::Harness::Remote>, except the
configuration file lives in C</.remote_test_ec2> -- see
L</"CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT">.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 load_remote_config

Loads and canonicalizes the configuration.  Writes and uses the
default configuration (L</default_config>) if the file does not exist.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

The configuration is stored in F<~/.remote_test_ec2>, and is mostly
identical to the configuration of L<TAP::Harness::Remote> (see
L<TAP::Harness::Remote/"CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT">), with the
following differences:

=over

=item *

The C<hosts> parameter is ignored, and produces a warning if present.

=item *

The C<access_key> amd C<secret_access_key> parameters are required, to
be able to query the Amazon EC2 interface and determine the running
EC2 hosts.  You can find your access keys at
L<https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key>

=item *

There is an optional C<ami> parameter, which limits which AMIs will be
used to run tests; it also lets the harness start the instances if
there are not enough running.

=item *

There is an optional C<instances> parameter, which specifies the
number of AMI instances to run tests on.  Defaults to one.

=item *

There is an optional C<instance_type> parameter, which controls the
type of instances to create; possible arguments are C<m1.small>,
C<m1.large>, and C<m1.xlarge>.  The default is C<m1.xlarge>.

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<Net::Amazon::EC2>, L<TAP::Harness::Remote>

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The default perl installed Amazon's provided EC2 images is
B<extremely> slow (about 4x slower than a clean, optimized build).  We
thus strongly suggest you compile your own.
